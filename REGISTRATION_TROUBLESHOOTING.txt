STUDENT REGISTRATION TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
==========================================

The registration system is WORKING correctly. If you're having issues, here are the most common problems and solutions:

ISSUE 1: "Register number is already registered"
-------------------------------------------------
Problem: You see this error when trying to register
Solution: This register number already exists in the system
  - Try with a DIFFERENT register number
  - Or contact admin to reset your account

ISSUE 2: Form shows errors but doesn't say what they are
-------------------------------------------
Problem: You click Register but nothing happens
Solution: The form has validation errors. Check these fields:
